Psuedo gravitational simulation -- no collision and does not strictly follow the inverse square law to compensate for no collisions. Collisions and a direct translation of Newton's gravitational law could be applied in this sim if enough particles or masses were included -- but that requires substantial optimization on the algorithm to update forces acted on the masses. O(n^2) time complexity, n is the amount of masses or particles in the sim -- beleive it is possible to reduce to nlogn with spatial lookup.
